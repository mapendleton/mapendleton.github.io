    <h1>Live Project</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        For the Tech Academy, I participated in a two week long Live Project. 
        This project was our chance, as students of the Tech Academy, to
        utilize all of the skills and knowledge that we had accumulated during
        the program. The project was a full scale MVC Web Application in C#, 
        including html and js. We worked as a team to tackle front end and back
        end stories to add features to the project. I learned a great many things
        working on this project. This was the largest project I've worked on, and
        I had to make sure I had a solid understanding of the project in order to 
        add features to it. That was a challenge, as some of the code was unfamiliar
        to me, but because of that I was able to learn a great deal before adding
        anything myself. I ran into some problems, but was able to look to my team
        for assistance. It was challenging but rewarding work, and in the end I was 
        able to create code that I am proud of. You can find examples of my work below.

        For this story I was tasked with pulling schedule data from a database to be displayed
        on the schedule view so the user could see any schedules displayed on a calendar.
        The project already had the necessary files to use a third party, open source, js,
        event calendar called FullCalendar. After familiarizing myself with FullCalendar I
        knew I had to create a schedule view model.

        In the schedule controller I created a new list of schedule view model objects, 
        pulled the necessary data from the data base and populated the list
        then sent the data to the schedule view.

        Taking the list of schedule view objects in the view, I converted it into JSON 
        and stored it in an html hidden input tag so I could retrieve the data in a separate js file.
        I then used the list of schedule views to create FullCalendar event objects to be displayed on
        their calendar.

        This story had me work on both the front end and back end, however, for front end part
        I used a barebones design mainly so I could focus on the back end functionality. I created
        an html post form with 7 sections for the 7 days of the week that stored user input into an
        array. When the user finishes the weekday form, a modal will pop up asking for for weekly info.

    <p>
        In the Schedule Controller, the HttpPost method "Create" takes the user input array as an array 
        of ScheduleWorkPeriod models. Using that information the method updates the schedule database and
        sends the user back to the index where they can see the new schedule on the calendar in the schedule view.
